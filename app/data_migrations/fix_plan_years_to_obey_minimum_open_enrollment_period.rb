# Purpose of this datafix:
# The plan year for some organization is not following the validation rule => Open enrollment period is less than minumum: 5 days
# This caused the organization / employer profile to fail saving.
# One issue where this was identified is Bug #8304 where broker was unable to assign GA because it silently failed to update of the employer_profile.
